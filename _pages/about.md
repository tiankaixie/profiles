I am a Ph.D. candidate in the field of visual analytics and explainable AI, with a focus on human-computer interaction, data visualization, and artificial intelligence. My research aims to design interactive systems that facilitate understanding and trust in data-driven decision making, empowering people to make sense of complex data and AI models and communicate their insights effectively. I am passionate about the potential of visual analytics and explainable AI to transform how we interact with and understand data, and is excited to contribute to this exciting and rapidly evolving field. 

At Arizona State University, I work with Dr. <a href="http://rmaciejewski.faculty.asu.edu/">Ross Maciejewski</a> as a member of the VADER lab. My research is supported by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the National Science Foundation Program on Fairness in AI in collaboration with Amazon.
